# Open-Source-AI-Based-Smart-Bin-and-PCB-Depopulation-System-for-E-Waste-Segregation
Open-source project combining an AI-based smart bin for simple e-waste sorting with a basic PCB depopulation system. Uses computer vision to detect and classify items, separate components, and support small-scale recycling. Includes starter hardware, control code, and easy-to-use AI models.
